Mr Jones and me that's Counting Crows right yeah right that is yeah okay Long December didn't that guy like date both Jennifer Aniston and yes he did um what's her name he had Rachel whoever played Rachel he had a really good run and Courtney Cox oh yeah Jennifer Anderson was Rachel Courtney Cox yeah like that's amazing to me because you know look you were in college you knew that if you met let's say all right so you're s what name me apartment complex you guys you guys Carriage Cove all right so you're in Carriage Cove was it did it have both uh Men's Rooms and women's all right so you you go over and you introduce yourself to a a room of uh of co-eds okay and you realiz and they're let's say they're all attractive and you're like okay I'm only going to have one shot with one person because once it goes bad with one it spoils you for the rest of the apartment right yep you lose the whole you lose the whole the whole apartment so you got to Choose Wisely well here this guy came in and dated a star of one of the most popular TV shows at the time and it didn't work out and what did he do he transitioned and dated the other one and who knows maybe he dated Phoebe too which in that day and that time those were the two most popular women in the United States of America and let's be honest that dude's not the most attractive guy out there I mean that wasn't chanting Tatum out there for some reason I can't remember his F I just remember he wore a loose flannel that when he would spin it would kind of float around and he uh and he had the dreadlocks as a white dude he was dreaded out wasn't he yeah cting Crows still you know that dude dated Jennifer Anderson and Courtney Cox no that's insane he he looks like the owl that got eaten by the tiger now granted that's a current picture oh okay but I mean he's not that far off anyway all right H and Scotty 975 the KL Sports Zone all right H it becomes official the Jazz have released it as uh lari marinin signs his extension is uh signs it on a day that will keep him in Utah for the entire season this isn't a no trade clause that can be uh dropped at any moment this is a um this is a legality based on NBA league rules he is unable to be traded for the next six months that'll take you through the season that obviously takes you past trade deadline so lari marinin will be a member of the the Utah Jazz for the 2024 2025 season react my initial thought is good no more of this nonsense about lari Markin being traded no more about any of that nonsense this dude is a young player in his prime give him his money build this team with him in mind and uh let's go the jazz jazz fans needed some good news they needed something to Rally around they needed a player be like okay you know what we're young we got a lot of rookies we got a lot of sophomore players but we have this guy and Jazz fans needed that they needed that guy I was talking to somebody earlier today who said I'm a jazz fan I'm having a hard time watching this but at least we have marinin and you you can say that at least you have marinin there's a look he's not going to win you 60 games by himself this year he's not LeBron dragging those Cleveland Cavaliers teams to an Eastern Conference Finals and NBA Finals just based on his sheer will and talent alone that's not lar marinin but he does give you some offensive pop he does give you something to be fired up about he does give you the price of admission he is an All-Star caliber player and you just don't give those away all willy-nilly and I'm glad that he's back for at least one more season I'll ask you the question ask Jake do you think he finishes this contract with the Utah Jazz no no I don't think so I think he's moved at some point in the Jazz ambition to get better long term but I do think for the 2425 season Jazz fans needed a little bit of security and a little bit of continuity how long does he play the good soldier before he's like I'm done with this uh the money is nice and I'm sure that's all he's thinking about right now he just doesn't strike me he's the kind of guy that's going to throw a fit about things okay if I were to set the over under on 32 wins this year yep uh I I I hope it's the under because if they're gonna if they're gonna if they're going to be bad they need to be bad no more of this they had 31 last year yeah no more of this flirting around and picking ninth to 12th overall if you're going to be bad be bad pick number two or number three give yourself a shot and remember Markin in how many games did he play last year like 50 at least 50 lari Markin had played 55 games last year that's the number he needs to be at this year because if he plays 70 Jazz will win 35 games Larry marinan needs to come down with some Rodney Hood gastrol intestinal distress more often than not but and and maybe maybe Lowry maybe it won't sit on his mind 28 wins won't defeat him but I think most competitors that are in it for something more than money it defeats them yeah it it eats at them really quick well and you worry if it doesn't honestly yeah if he's just sitting there okay with 28 wins and because I think that's what Gordon Hayward turned in late in his career what how do you think the Jazz are selling themselves to lry right now is it hey Lowry just bear with us it's coming and when it hits you're G to be a big piece of this and when it hits we are going to make a championship run is that how they sell that to him I I think so or do you sell anything and just lar it's money we can give you more than any I mean let's let's be honest you know it's like the the old boss we used to have that Lloyd and I make fun of all the time that said your thanks comes on the 1 and the 15th you know and I'd go in like hey you know what these guys are busting their butt can you give them a shout out he go I tell them thanks on the first and the 15th that's when their checks come in that's all they need and you know if you really want to be Draconian about it and just be like you know what hey lri uh we're giving you 220 million in new money on a $238 million contract extension uh you're welcome we don't need to sell you on wins we don't need to sell you on that we're giving you essentially the gross domestic product of the country of Venezuela oh oh what's that you you want input on what direction we're headed here's the direction we're headed you're making $220 million worry about that yeah get better as a basketball player I I just wonder how you handle this I but you know that's that's an easy thing for us to say but in reality you're right that's not the real world when it comes to athletes they want their money and they want they want a commitment from you that you're going to help them win a ring well I can't put myself in the world of basketball in NBA I can put myself in the world in NFL and then NFL you have to win or all of your contracts are n and void exactly everybody's contract is expendable and they don't got to pay it out but the NBA like he's got that money so it's done he's going to make that money no matter what happens he's going to make that money so it's like I I wonder if I could be a little bit more complacent and win and winning and losing if I didn't feel like they were going to dismantle the team and cut my contract I wonder if I could be just a little bit more accepting of a 28 win season just a little bit more accepting that instead of averaging 25 and a half I average 23 because I didn't have somebody that was forcing other looks I mean let's be honest here hands you're a competitor you're the most competitive person that I personally know I don't like to lose like I I've seen it on display and it's fun to watch and it it shows me the success that you've had why you've had success on the football field and in life overall and and on radio you you know your drive makes me want to be better um um and so I love your competitive nature it's just born in you and I admire the hell out of it I wonder how hard so so knowing who you are as a person and how competitive you are as a person but imagine your Lori marinin okay and you just got this big fat contract extension but yet you're on a team that next year is not expected to win and frankly isn't highly motivated to win like they see the talent that's be in the top three or four picks deep down if you're going to give true serm to Danny a he wants this team to bottom out next year so you're like I got my guaranteed money I got my contract extension why should I be busting my ass in the off season getting myself ready for this upcoming year why should I yeah I mean frankly you probably don't want me to do that it feels it seems like you would be a little bit gutted like like I could I can see how hard it would be like it it would be really difficult for me to blame a player when the organization right now going into the season isn't putting winning at a high priority so if you're not committed to winning why do I need to be committed to winning I'm I'm GNA get my money regardless so why should I be killing myself at workouts at 4:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. and 2 p.m getting ready for the upcoming season I'm going to go eat some crumbled cookies and I'm going to go have myself a Time m the one of the hardest things for me by the way that new German chocolate cookie is really good what I'm sorry which one I don't know there's a new cookie out that's really Delight it's a German chocolate cookie is it a protein cookie it's layer no it's not protein are you normally a German chocolate guy uh not really but this one I had a little I'm not a German chocolate I had a little piece of one the other night just little sliver every time I go German chocolate I'm I get excited I'm like German chocolate and then I eat it I'm like like cuz I love coconut and I love chocolate but I hate German you know what that's how I am normally too um you know the other kind too is Biscoff like I always think oh I'm gonna love that and then I have it and then I'm like oh I know I hate AB Biscoff I won't eat it the other thing for me is baklava oh really yeah yeah Baka is the worst but you look at it your looks delightful you think oh well this is going to be pleasant you take a bite of it you're like what is this trash no no like that's I and I you so you hate Biscoff right off the gate but like I'm always like you see that gooey Center you're like oh man this is going to be really good and then you take a bite into it like no anyway sorry so if I'm Larry marinin and I I have a really tough time I've played basketball and I have a good understanding of the concepts of it and you know we went to those camps yeah with Coach Snyder and you get some conceptual understanding of what they're doing what they're asking and Scotty I look at a starting five in basketball kind of like I look at an offensive line if if there's a part that's not functioning then your job is miserable and if I'm Larry Markin and and let's say I'm Larry and I've got and keontay George who's gonna be in a sophomore season yeah Taylor Hendricks um let's go Drew Eubanks I don't know we'll go Walker Kesler yeah um in his third year and then I've got rotators of Isaiah Coler and Cody Williams and my only real stability is maybe Colin seon yeah and and I'm looking around like and let's honest you're not helping me and let's be honest what's the likelihood of Colin seon being on this roster at the end of the season him or Jordan Clarks yeah slim to none yeah I don't know about John Collins I think Collins is certainly on the blocks as well like like I would say two out of those three will not be with the team in April yeah or at the trade the day after the trade deadline okay so now I'm playing with Coler Williams s b now I'm seeing rotations maybe of Philipi yeah oh yeah absolutely he'll be in the mix and then you start to wonder well how much how important is money but then how important is my name how important is my next contract how important is my legacy yeah how important is my relationship with the fans because fans don't like me when I've got 28 wins I Lowry's fun but 28 wins is 28 wins and as a fan base you're like yeah you're great but gez this sucks I mean who was the guy I he was a good player who was the guy with the the shot the Wheezy um came in after Carlos Boozer uh the big man oh Big Mo Big Al Big Al Al Jefferson Al Jefferson was a good NBA player not a great NBA player but he was a fine good NBA player that would have been a nice piece surrounded by Superstars yeah but he was brought in he had a coach who Tyron Corbin just the nicest human being on the planet not a good head coach just not a good head coach and then there was nobody else around him and so he had to be the face of a team and he wasn't capable of leading a team and he wasn't is n good enough of being the number one option on a team and so he gets all these arrows thrown at him like you suck you're no good but well he was put in a really bad situation and was asked to do things and really asked to carry a team where he's he was incapable of carrying a team now Larry marinan is a far better player than Al Jefferson and far um better to handle that situation but still we're asking a lot we're asking a lot of Markin if you're expecting him to lead this team to the playoffs and that's not fair to him and you're right if the fan base turns on him like they did Al Jefferson that's a really sad thing because he doesn't deserve that did the fans ever turned on akk uh yes but that was more because of his contract okay and and I don't think Lowry's ever becomes an albatross no yeah I mean and when I say the contract it wasn't about the money being paid it was the length of the contract yeah and it was the time of because you had Darren and Boozer and you and but you couldn't do anything you couldn't trade AKA CU nobody wanted him and he still had all these years left on his contract they had to use them and you didn't have the financial flexibility because of that contract to bring in any help and so that's that's where the uh backlash came against AK and then he's crying in the middle of the playoff run in Houston which was weird all right 227 hands of Scotty uh coming up next we're going to spin the wheel It Sports orlet straight ahead right here on 975 this is Jake Scott and Ben Anderson I would battle Jazz fans and just say like be bad for a couple years who cares it doesn't matter it's going to be good for you making the playoffs is stupid right now it doesn't benefit you it's bad for you as a fan actually and then the white socks I'm like man I'd give anything for a first round playoff elimination the fan in me just wants any type of success even if it lowers the longterm ceiling of the team most fans feel obligated to defend the bozo Behavior people who are even like White Sox fans like hey I don't know if this franchise is headed in the right direction then the the loyal one is like how dare you I can talk about all the flaws of our state but when I go to California and get an Uber and someone says hey isn't Utah this stupid place I'm like whoa pal listen bud I'll drag you out pretty good town actually here Jake Scott and Ben Anderson every day from 10 to no 975d KSL Sports [Music] Zone the wheel is loaded and it's time to talk some sports this is sports roulette with Hansen Scotty on 975 the KSL Sports Z [Music] hey Olson Scott Gerard 975 the KSL Sports Zone time for another edition of sports rette we take some of the biggest story lines put on Rel let will we spin it wherever that little ball lands what we end up talking about hope you're all having a good uh is it Wednesday today it is Wednesday ah week's going by fast college football folks is going to be here before you know it NFL preseason more games are going to get underway coming up here a little bit later on we got all kinds of stuff happening let's go can't wait for this all right let's get to it Lloyd fire up that wheel does it even matter anymore so the NC NCAA announced a four-year show cause order for Jim Harbaugh yes today and this actually doesn't have anything to do with the sign stealing allegations people are confusing this because when he was exiting remember there was the big sence stealing allegation and and all of his achievements were in question because of it that that's not this this was improper contact during covid yes and now he's got a four-year show cause order which essentially it's there's a one season suspension if he comes back to college football he cannot coach for a full season and at this point does it mean anything does it tarnish his reputation does it hurt him if he wants to come back does he ever want to come back do you ever think of Pete Carroll in terms of NCAA issues no because he essentially Jim Harbaugh did the same thing Pete Caroll did Pete saw the NCAA coming and he saw the issues that were coming from the Reggie Bush and and you know some of the other stuff that was going on and said all right I got the Seahawks ready to give me a job I'm I'm going to get out ahead of this if Pete would have been fired from the NFL in two years then maybe but he's got such a legacy of coaching now in the league that nobody even thinks about yeah what happened in between if Harbaugh sucks which I don't see him winning with the Chargers I hope not does anybody uh I think he might I think he could get that thing turned around like I mean I mean I know it ended poorly in San Francisco but remember he took that he took Colin Kaepernick to a Super Bowl yeah yeah he did and they were what about 15 yards away from winning the thing or sending it to overtime I can't remember but anyway I mean they they had they had it they hadn't they had an opportunity there well if if he can turn it around and he can make his name again with the league and he's not a quick one or two exit then I just think that it's a but if he's fired pretty quick then everybody's like will he come back to college football well can he come back he can't yeah so and it doesn't if I'm reading this right and and you if you know more than I do it doesn't matter like it doesn't the four years doesn't start right now it starts whenever he wants to come back so like let's say six years from now he wants to come back that's when it's going to hit right yes so it's not like next season with or without him playing college football no it's delayed for his return exactly yeah yeah so yeah because the the verbiage on it is a one-year suspension if he returns to college football that's the that's the verbage so yeah it'll be delayed and then the four-year show cause order so oneyear suspension suspension fouryear show cause and all of this goes back to co recruiting violation yeah all right Lloyd spin it wrong Billy Bean mad dog have you heard this whole thing oh Chris Russo well this put you in a really bad position because essentially you you end up making it sound like somebody's death isn't important once you find out it's not who you think yeah here's mad dog getting Billy beans confused the word that we're getting right now is that the general manager of the A's Billy Bean may have passed away wow was he ill wasn't aware of this I mean he's not that old geez was it sudden we see if we can get some information wow that is a terrible story with Billy Bean of the A's H I don't know anything about it this is the first I've heard uh you know he's a he's in a he's an historic General Manager on a team that uh you know he built very good teams with not a lot to work with financially the movie of course with Brad Pit uh he's probably no more than 62 or three 60 wow leukemia that's a terrible story so Billy Bean uh of the A's now had he taken a leave of absence in the last whatever it might be to I didn't even know I'm sure his cohorts in a sport knew um you know he's very close to Cashman so I'm sure Brian knew I didn't hear any of this and I'm on the Bas Channel every day or or thereabouts so that's a terrible story of Billy Bean now let me read read it to you Billy fought an heroic year-long battle with acute leukemia uh that's the wrong Billy Bean that's not the Billy Bean from the A's uh last 10 years Billy worked passionately and tirelessly with M Mo and all 30 clubs focusing on player education uh he played 10 he played uh six 10 year playing career with six teams that's the different Billy Bean still a terrible story but that's not the Billy Bean that's not the the bean of the days that's the uh Billy Bean who worked for Major League Baseball so it's a different Billy Bean so we apologize if we got that screwed up uh it's spelled differently this Billy Bean is spelled uh I it's spelled differently than the other one commissioner Manford cor Billy one of the kindest and most respected individuals I have ever known and someone who made better made baseball a better institution both on and uh we apologize if we screw this up no no there's no if you screwed it up and it's not we yeah it's you you although I'm sure there was a producer like hey Billy Bean just died not the only by the way I saw this so I saw this like come I was like wait what and I started reading about this Billy Bean I'm like that there was some stuff about this certain Billy Bean that you would have thought would have been in the movie and I was like this is confusing some of the stories even had it wrong like he wasn't the only one yeah no because he he's played a role in Major League Baseball so a couple things number one he was the Dei director he's one of the first open League gay players so there were a lot of things about Billy Bean that separated him came out in 99 and I was like this wasn't in Money Ball you're right Lloyd like there are things that's and that's why I think he was reading the story and he's like oh this is wrong Billy Bean it's spelled different the 10 years should like I had a 10-year career should have given it away cuz Billy Bean did not have that type of career did the Moneyball guy even make it in the league at all he was for a brief brief very brief I've never seen he went right down I don't even know if he you haven't watched Money Ball I haven't I think you'd like it do you I don't know what do you think Lloyd would he like Money Ball that's a tough one I think you would Scotty recommends it I'll tell okay I'll I'll tell you this I walked out of Draft Day oh it's way better than draft draft day is trash yeah draft day sucks I could I couldn't stomach it even for yeah more seconds done I think you would you would like the Billy Bean character yeah and how he was portrayed I think I think you would like it who portrays him uh Brad Pit oh oh okay sorry that's got Jonah Hill I know you don't like Jonah Hill but Jah I do oh you do I like funny but he's not funny no it's not funny Jah he's he's he's serious Jonah Hill but he's still fat Jonah Hill okay which is still good yeah it's better than skinny non-funny Jonah Hill he's got some nerdy nerdy you know what I I have about a I'm going to put it about confidence level that you would like money ball at about 70% okay in terms of Sport the story the story of the A's that year like it's a cool story it's a really cool story in terms of and and you know how much I love roster costs like I I'm that's one thing I keep track of with i'mna go I'm gonna go 75% take it up a little I'm gonna take it up a little bit 75% I'm gonna give it a try I think you should watch it take put that in my notes do you know I keep a note a movie list on my notes oh yeah you want me to go through it yeah of movies you have not seen but you're

His legacy extends beyond his personal achievements and athletic career; Billy Bean made substantial strides in advocating for equality and inclusivity in sports. Through his work, he developed policies and practices that promoted an inclusive environment, making baseball a sport that values diversity. His efforts have left an indelible mark on the game, fostering a culture of acceptance that will benefit future generations of athletes.

The MLB community, including Commissioner Rob Manfred, expressed their deep condolences and remembered Bean as a kind and respected individual whose contributions have made a lasting impact on baseball both on and off the field. His story is a testament to the strength, hope, and transformative power of living authentically, and his passing is a significant loss to all who advocate for equality and inclusion in sports.

Unique Points:
1. Bean was one of the very few MLB players who openly identified as gay, marking a milestone in sports history.
2. He was pivotal in developing MLB's diversity and inclusion policies, transforming the league's culture.
3. His post-retirement roles as the Ambassador for Inclusion and Vice President of MLB were instrumental in promoting LGBTQ+ acceptance.
4. His death brought attention to his significant contributions to diversity not just in baseball but in professional sports at large.
5. Despite facing many personal challenges, his courage and advocacy work left a profound legacy impacting future generations of athletes.
