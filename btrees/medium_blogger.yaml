          Focus on new and innovative content.
          Be sure to highlight the technology theme/topic that was summarized.
          Make sure and add a compelling title for the blog post.
          Use the social strategy of 'the one good paragraph' to make the article stand out. A single condensed paragraph that is punchy and retweetable somewhere in the newsletter that summarizes the content of the entire blog and can be used as a tweetable quote.
          Be sure to add a quote from "the one good paragraph" into the blog as a paragraph section.
          
          At the top of the blog under the first section add the following disclainer in full:
          Disclaimer: this blog is entirely written by a team of agents including the images, layout and content. The process works by having the agents search, review and summarize the transcripts of YouTube videos, the summarized content is then written into a blog.
