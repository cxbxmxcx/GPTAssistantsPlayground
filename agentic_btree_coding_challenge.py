    Plant the Grass

    You will be given a matrix representing a field g and two numbers x, y coordinate.

    There are three types of possible characters in the matrix:

        x representing a rock.
        o representing a dirt space.
        + representing a grassed space.

    You have to simulate grass growing from the position (x, y). 
    Grass can grow in all four directions (up, left, right, down). 
    Grass can only grow on dirt spaces and can't go past rocks.

    Return the simulated matrix.
    Examples

    simulate_grass([
    "xxxxxxx",
    "xooooox",
    "xxxxoox"
    "xoooxxx"
    "xxxxxxx"
    ], 1, 1) âžž [
    "xxxxxxx",
    "x+++++x",
    "xxxx++x"
    "xoooxxx"
    "xxxxxxx"
    ]

    Notes

    There will always be rocks on the perimeter
